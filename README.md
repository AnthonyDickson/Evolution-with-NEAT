# Evolution with NEAT
In this project I aim to build a web-based game.
In this game the main goal is to create a creature than can move to the right as far as possible 
within a given time limit.
These creatures will be generated by a genetic algorithm or by the player.
The player can try to design a creature that is better than what the genetic algorithm comes up 
with.

For the genetic algorithm I intend to implement neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT).
The creatures will be round nodes connected with muscles. The nodes will have friction and the
muscles will contract and relax at a given interval. The interaction between muscles and nodes
should allow the creatures to move. For the physics I intend to use matter.js, and for rendering
I will use the default renderer that comes with matter.js.

## Getting Started
1.  Install NVM (Node Version Manager):
    ```shell script
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
    ```
    You may need to restart your terminal to be able to use NVM.
    
2.  Install Node and NPM (Node Package Manager):
    ```shell script
    nvm install 10.16.1
    ```
    
3.  Verify your Node and NPM installation:
    ```shell script
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

1.  Install the dependencies:
    ```shell script
    npm install
    ```

2.  Start the development server:
    ```shell script
    npm start
    ```
